<h1>Presidential debate: Trump or Clinton?</h1>

<p>Business mogul Donald Trump hates the prospect of losing, and being the “loser.” </p>


<p> All his life, he claims, he has never tasted “defeat,” only “winning” so when asked if he would accept the election outcome at Wednesday night’s presidential debate, he fidgeted.</p>


<p>  “I’ll tell you at the time, I’ll keep you in suspense,” Trump told Chris Wallace, the moderator of the debate.</p> 

<p> An unprecedented move by a presidential candidate, Trump’s unruly demeanor and unconventional and outlandish ways, ultimately cost him the third and final presidential debate, despite an improved performance from his last two debates.</p> 

<p> After months of intense political campaign, democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her opponent, Trump, both headed into the debate arena at Las Vegas Wednesday night with different goals.  

<p> For Trump, the debate was his last-ditch effort at redeeming himself after recently plagued with accusations of sexual assault and two poor showings in the previous debates. While for Clinton, this was her opportunity to tie the final bow to a long presidential campaign, and with her currently leading the polls; she’s a step closer to sealing the presidency.</p> 

<p> Although Trump was more disciplined this time around, keeping his cool for most of the time, he was still unable to hold the ground against his rival, who sharply outsmarted him several times that night.</p> 

<p> In my opinion, Trump lost the debate after he refused to accept the results of the election. His claims that the election is rigged, not only fuels underlying racist remarks, but also undermines the democratic traditions this country has long held onto. Trump’s inability to explain his abusive behavior towards women also triggered the defeat.</p>  

<p> Stakes were high for both candidates — but Clinton came out top after she was able to prove her worth through several important segments in the debate.</p>  

<p> For instance, Clinton once again demonstrated to be the torchbearer for women across the nation, opening her remark by asserting her commitment to upholding the values laid out in Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion in the United States. She also highlighted the importance for standing up to minorities by not overturning marriage equality. </p>   

<p> Her counterpart’s defense to the issue, and multiple others that night, however, fell short due to his lack of knowledge on the topics. Trump’s attack on Clinton regarding late term abortion for example, was inaccurate — like most of his statements or “facts” — throughout the campaign.</p>  

<p> But that wasn’t Trump’s only mistake. </p>   

<p> The billionaire continued his streak of baseless racial attacks at this debate, saying, “We have some bad hombres here and we have to get them out,” a move meant to stoke fear of Latino people. 

<p> Previously, Trump had declared Mexicans as rapists who bring drugs and crime into the country. Trump’s tendencies to make lazy sweeping overgeneralizations towards minorities however, wasn’t limited to Mexicans, he proposed blocking Muslim immigration, and having Muslims own identification cards as a means of countering terrorism — essentially blaming all Muslims, even moderates, for the acts for a few extremists.</p>    

<p> But that wasn’t the only attack of the night from Trump that handed Clinton the win, he consistently, without fail, attacked his opponent calling her a “nasty women” and a “liar” — attacks that bare no significance and only undercut his own character and reputation as a presidential candidate.</p> 

<p> However, Trump’s lost wasn’t only because of his errors. Clinton, to her credit, made some excellent points, her experience as a veteran politician highlighted in this debate, though she still managed to dodge the controversial topic of her emails. She was able to capitalize on Trump’s major weaknesses, and came out top.</p>  

<p> Trump’s incapability to show voters that he can be thoughtful and measured in tough situations is a good early predictor of how he’ll perform as the leader of the free world.</p>  

<p>  So Trump, for now, you’ve lost.

<h1>Social Media Post</h1>

<p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump battled it out on stage for their third and final presidential debate on Oct. 19 at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. </p>

<p>Fox anchor and debate moderator Chris Wallace started the debate with the topic of the U.S. Supreme Court. </p>

<p>Clinton said she believes the Court should “stand on the side” of the American people, which includes not overturning marriage equality, and Roe v. Wade. Clinton’s vision of the Court also includes standing up against Citizen United.  </p>

<p>Trump responded to this by promising to appoint pro-life justices and to stand by a more originalist interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. </p>

<p>Wallace then proceeded to discuss the Second Amendment of the Constitution. In that discussion, Clinton said she supports and respects the right to bear arms.  </p>

<p>However, Clinton emphasized the importance of gun control reformation by increasing gun regulations, implementing comprehensive background checks and by closing the online gun loophole. 

<p>Trump responded by referencing the futility of the strict gun laws in Chicago, which he said has one of the highest gun violence rates in the country. He said he intends to appoint justices who “feel strongly” about the Second Amendment to keep gun rights as robust as possible. </p>

<p>The debate soon turned contentious, as candidates when into the topic of abortion. When asked if Trump would reverse Roe v. Wade, he responded by saying cases of abortion would “go back to the states.” Clinton said she supports Roe v. Wade and the rights of women to receive an abortion. </p>

<p>Soon, the debate headed into the issue of immigration. Clinton said she advocates for secure and reform borders and has a package for illegal immigrants to secure citizenship, opposite of Trump who has been calling for major deportation alongside building a “wall”.  </p>

<p>The heat of the debate continued to rise as Wallace asked Trump if he condemns interference by Russia in the American election. </p>

<p>“By Russia or anyone else. Of course I condemn,” Trump said bewilderedly. </p>

<p>The next topic after immigration was the economy. Wallace pointed out that Clinton’s economical plans for the country contain more government involvement, which include more taxes. Trump’s, on the other hand, involves government deregulation with lower taxes.  </p>

<p>Clinton noted that her plans center on flourishing the American middle class. “I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives,” she said, adding that she plans on growing the economy by providing more job programs. This plan, she said, also involve helping small businesses and increasing the national minimum wage.  </p>

<p>Clinton said she also wants to ensure that women get paid equally to their male counterpart for the same work that they do. Clinton also emphasized the need to provide more technical education in schools, and to make college tuition free.  </p>

<p>Clinton then went on to criticize Trump’s plan, which she said would result in a huge lost of number of jobs, provide the biggest tax breaks to the wealthiest in the country, and possibly a recession.  </p>

<p>Trump responded by saying that Clinton’s economical plans will see a major tax increase that will affect the American people. Trump said his plans include engaging in more free trade and greater tax cuts. “I am going to renegotiate NAFTA,” he said. </p>

<p>Clinton responded by promising no tax increase for anyone making less than $250,000 annually, no deficit increase and a track to eliminate the national debt. </p>

<p>Trump denied allegations of sexual assault brought up against him at the debate. </p>

<p>When asked if he would accept the election outcome, he said, “I will look at it at the time.” Clinton responded to Trump by criticizing him for his claims that the election is rigged, saying, “that is not how democracy works.”  </p>

<p>On the topic of foreign relations, Clinton said she doesn’t support the idea of putting American forces in Iraq as an occupying force. She noted the current goal is to retain Mosul, Iraq. </p>

<p>In order to protect the American people, Clinton plans on having an intelligence surge in the country, while continuing to push for “no fly zones and safe havens” in Syria as a way to encourage negotiations to end the conflict.  </p>

<p>Trump responded by claiming he doesn’t support the invasion of Iraq, and criticized the lack of an “element of surprise” in the war.  </p>

<p>When asked about the state of Aleppo, Trump went ahead and put the blame on Clinton, adding that she was “outsmarted” by Bashar Al Assad, the current president of Syria.  </p>

<p>Both candidates then proceeded to give their wrap-ups of the night. Clinton emphasized her aim to stand up for families against powerful corporations. Trump stressed to make America “strong and great again”.   </p>
