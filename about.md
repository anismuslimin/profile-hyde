I'm the metro editor at [the Daily Iowan](http://daily-iowan.com) and a member of the University of Iowa [School of Journalism and Mass Communication](http://clas.uiowa.edu/sjmc/) Class of 2017.

I have proven expertise in [journalistic reporting and writing](https://muckrack.com/anis-shakirah-mohd-muslimin/portfolio) and [multimedia storytelling](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOVUjd9aOG6UZXVFbZZb2Pw). I am currently on University of Iowa [International Student Advisory Board](https://uisg.uiowa.edu/index.php/news/apply-for-international-student-advisory-board/). 

My name is Anis Shakirah Mohd Muslimin, I'm a senior at the Univeristy of Iowa double majoring in Journalism and Mass Communication and Psychology. The dream job is t be a reporter who writes about social issues. I am heavily interested in writing about features or covering news realted to social issues.   
 
A news junkie, I hope to use my ability as a journalist to share stories of people, but more importantly, hold powerful individuals and groups accountable. I'm extremely passionate about social issues such as poverty, racism and equality — as seen in some of my writings.

I bring diversity to the table as seen by my background as a minority. I have proven reporting and writing skills as well as commitment, evident through my work and my service as the Daily Iowan metro editor. I know a third language — I am proficient in the Malay Language, which is similar to the Indonesian Language, while I also have elementary proficiency in both Mandarin and Arabic. My works can be seen on [Daily Iowan](http://daily-iowan.com/?s=anis+shakirah+mohd+muslimin).

As a reporter, I value accuracy, accountability and teamwork.
