My name is Anis Shakirah Mohd Muslimin, I'm a senior at the Univeristy of Iowa double majoring in Journalism and Mass Communication and Psychology. The dream job is t be a reporter who writes about social issues. I am heavily interested in writing about features or covering news realted to social issues.   
 
A news junkie, I hope to use my ability as a journalist to share stories of people, but more importantly, hold powerful individuals and groups accountable. I'm extremely passionate about social issues such as poverty, racism and equality — as seen in some of my writings.

I bring diversity to the table as seen by my background as a minority. I have proven reporting and writing skills as well as commitment, evident through my work and my service as the Daily Iowan metro editor. I know a third language — I am proficient in the Malay Language, which is similar to the Indonesian Language, while I also have elementary proficiency in both Mandarin and Arabic. My works can be seen on [Daily Iowan](http://daily-iowan.com/?s=anis+shakirah+mohd+muslimin).

As a reporter, I value accuracy, accountability and teamwork.
