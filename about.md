 My name is Anis Shakirah Mohd Muslimin, I'm a senior at the Univeristy of Iowa double majoring in Journalism and Mass Communication and Psychology. The dream job is t be a reporter who writes about social issues. I am heavily interested in writing about features or covering news realted to social issues.   
 
A news junkie, I hope to use my ability as a journalist to share stories of people, but more importantly, hold powerful individuals and groups accountable. I'm extremely passionate about social issues such as poverty, racism and equality — as seen in some of my writings.

I bring diversity to the table as seen by my background as a minority. I have proven reporting and writing skills as well as commitment, evident through my work and my service as the Daily Iowan metro editor. I know a third language — I am proficient in the Malay Language, which is similar to the Indonesian Language, while I also have elementary proficiency in both Mandarin and Arabic. My works can be seen on [Daily Iowan](http://daily-iowan.com/?s=anis+shakirah+mohd+muslimin).

As a reporter, I value accuracy, accountability and teamwork.

Some clips of my work:

### The Daily Iowan 

#### Muslimin: Burqini ban undermines personal freedom

This an opinion piece I wrote after the French Government announced the burqini ban. The hijab has long been a hot-button issue in the Western world, with views varying from either end of the spectrum. I identify as a Muslim, and I wear the hijab too, so it only made sense for me to write a commentary that was so close to my heart.

#### Wage gap persist at the University of Iowa

The wage gap between male and female faculty members across the United States has always been a hotly constested issue. After going over data from the American Association of University Professors, I noticed a salary gap between male and female faculty, and I decided to get a better understanding of the issue by talking to school officials about it. The conclusion that I got that from my mini investigation is that a gap indeed exist, however, some school administrators insist that these numbers should not be taken at face value.

#### Tattoos in the workplace raise eyebrows

While on my summer internship at the Quad City Times in Davenport, Iowa I wrote a story about tattoos in the workplace. I had to conduct a mini investgation to find out if tattoos were in fact a "thing" in workplaces around the Quad Cities. Career edvisors suggest that tattoos although have been more common in the workplace, is not quite the norm yet, and it best be avoided, at least while in the Quad Cities.

#### It's a ducky life for Wapello man

This is a piece I wrote while at the QC Times. Brandon Brown, 35, from Wapello, Iowa is a high school teacher who hand makes duck calls. Despite his tight work schedule that involves teaching and coaching, he still finds time to make duck calls just because of how passionate he is about it. This was a fun feature I wrote for the Muscatine Journal, who are associated with the Quad City Times. This story was picked up the AP wire in Iowa, and the [Des Moines Register](http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2016/08/20/wapello-teacher-makes-duck-calls-hand/88960562/) and even the [Miami Herald](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article96356132.html) shared my story.
