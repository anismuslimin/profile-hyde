### The Daily Iowan 

#### Muslimin: Burqini ban undermines personal freedom

This an opinion piece I wrote after the French Government announced the burqini ban. The hijab has long been a hot-button issue in the Western world, with views varying from either end of the spectrum. I identify as a Muslim, and I wear the hijab too, so it only made sense for me to write a commentary that was so close to my heart.

#### Wage gap persist at the University of Iowa

![logo](public/unnamed-692x360.jpg)

The wage gap between male and female faculty members across the United States has always been a hotly constested issue. After going over data from the American Association of University Professors, I noticed a salary gap between male and female faculty, and I decided to get a better understanding of the issue by talking to school officials about it. The conclusion that I got that from my mini investigation is that a gap indeed exist, however, some school administrators insist that these numbers should not be taken at face value.

#### Tattoos in the workplace raise eyebrows

While on my summer internship at the Quad City Times in Davenport, Iowa I wrote a story about tattoos in the workplace. I had to conduct a mini investgation to find out if tattoos were in fact a "thing" in workplaces around the Quad Cities. Career advisors suggest that tattoos although have been more common in the workplace, is not quite the norm yet, and it best be avoided, at least while in the Quad Cities.

#### It's a ducky life for Wapello man

This is a piece I wrote while at the QC Times. Brandon Brown, 35, of Wapello, Iowa is a high school teacher who hand makes duck calls. Despite his tight work schedule that involves teaching and coaching, he still finds time to make duck calls just because of how passionate he is about it. This was a fun feature I wrote for the Muscatine Journal, who are associated with the Quad City Times. This story was picked up the AP wire in Iowa, and the [Des Moines Register](http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2016/08/20/wapello-teacher-makes-duck-calls-hand/88960562/) and even the [Miami Herald](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article96356132.html) shared my story. 

#### First Generation students: A feature story

For class, I wrote a feature story surrounding several first generation students from multiple backgrounds at the University of Iowa. One example of the students that I talked to was Stacey Murray. Her story was esepcially impactful to me because she started out as a small town girl to being the Editor-in-Chief of the Daily Iowan â€” one the nation's biggest college newspapers. Murray is originally from Hopkinton, Iowa, which according to the Census Bureau consisted of only 628 people in 2015. She was also the recipient of the prestigious Bill Mertens Memorial Daily Iowan Scholarship. For more info check it out at [guidetocollegeprobz](https://guidetocollegeprobz.wordpress.com)
